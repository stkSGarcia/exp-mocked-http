## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: File-Backed Response Body Loading
The system SHALL load `reply_http.body_from_file` content during mock definition loading.

#### Scenario: Body file path resolves relative to templates directory
- **WHEN** a loaded behavior defines `reply_http.body_from_file`
- **THEN** the system SHALL resolve the path relative to `HM_TEMPLATES_DIR`

#### Scenario: Body file is snapshotted at load time
- **WHEN** a loaded behavior defines `reply_http.body_from_file`
- **THEN** the system SHALL store a stable snapshot of the file contents for that loaded configuration

#### Scenario: Missing body file is rejected
- **WHEN** a loaded behavior defines `reply_http.body_from_file` and the resolved file does not exist
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject that behavior as invalid

#### Scenario: Body file path outside templates directory is rejected
- **WHEN** a loaded behavior defines `reply_http.body_from_file` that resolves outside `HM_TEMPLATES_DIR`
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject that behavior as invalid
